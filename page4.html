    <h2>Promises</h2>
    <p>I promise to try — even on days when I feel small. I promise to show up, to say sorry when I mess up, and to celebrate every tiny victory with you.</p>
    <p>I'll bring you tea, I'll carry your umbrella badly, and I'll cheer for you at the finish line, even if it's just finishing a tough week.</p>
    <p>These are the small vows that build a life together.</p>
