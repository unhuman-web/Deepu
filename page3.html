    <h2>Adventures I want with you</h2>
    <p>Let's go to places that don't have names in our map yet. I want to wander, get lost, and find new favorite cafés with you. I want to learn the languages of small towns and try every dessert we can find.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Road trip with zero plan</li>
      <li>Midnight stargazing on a quiet hill</li>
      <li>Cooking something that goes wrong but tastes perfect anyway</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Everything feels like an adventure that’s better if you’re there.</p>
