    <h2>For my dearest Deepu</h2>
    <p>I remember the first time I saw you — the little laugh, the way sunlight caught your hair. You make ordinary days feel like a song I want to keep playing.</p>
    <p>There are thousand tiny reasons and a few big ones. Today I'm asking the biggest: will you please be mine?</p>
    <p>I want to make you happy and I want to explore the world with you. I want to give you everything that you missed in this time and I promise I will treat you like a queen. Remember I'm all yours and you're all mine and mine only.</p>
    <p>Love, always.</p>
