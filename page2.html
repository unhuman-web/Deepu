    <h2>The Little Things</h2>
    <p>I love how you take care of small details — the kind of person who leaves Post-it notes on days that feel heavy.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your laugh (it’s my favorite alarm)</li>
      <li>Your stubborn kindness</li>
      <li>How you remember tiny facts about people</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are small things, but together they make the biggest map of why I want to be with you.</p>
